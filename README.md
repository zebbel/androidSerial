# androidSerial
To work with the canBus adapter on MTC Android Head Units the serial Modul is needed.

This is the compiled version of serial to make it easier to use in Android Studio projects.

Included is also the source from which I compiled the library.

The serial library is used in CanBus app wich replaces the HCTCanBus app.
